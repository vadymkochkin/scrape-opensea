The collection also includes eight sets of twins and one set of triplets. This was not by design, but a serendipitous accident as @blairz is a twin and was born in 1989, which was the inspiration for the collection name and number of Sisters.

A development from my Lux Noctis (drone lighting) project, this series focuses more on the intimate landscape, using practical in-camera lighting effects to interact with the immediate surroundings. As it gets dark, my surroundings cease to be an exterior experience and become a subliminal space, and that’s when I feel most connected and aware of my sense of being. This dynamic terrestrial chiaroscuro synchronises with my sound design and music to form singular looping pieces which draws the viewer in.",https://niftygateway.com/collections/exstasis,,,

Reimagining the way NFTs are used, The Currency is a collection of 10,000 NFTs which correspond to 10,000 unique physical artworks which are stored in a secure vault in the UK. The works are now brought to life through their launch on the blockchain.

Starting with the creation of the physical artworks in 2016, The Currency explores the boundaries of art and currency—when art changes and becomes a currency, and when currency becomes art. Successful applicants will all initially receive NFTs. Ultimately, you have to decide between the digital NFT or the physical artwork, both of which are artworks in their own right. Whichever you pick, the other gets burned.

The collection is on the Palm blockchain, which is a new token-powered ecosystem for NFTs connected to Ethereum. It is 99% more energy efficient than proof of work systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. The Currency NFTs can be moved to Ethereum.",https://currency.nft.heni.com/,https://discord.gg/98SrzyMmbZ,https://twitter.com/HENI,https://instagram.com/heni

- For “Twin Flames” I photographed 100 sets of twins in honor of my fraternal twin, aiming to create body of work focused on the existence of multiple births and the phenomena of twindom through an immersive portrait survey. Twins and multiple siblings provide a lens on the magic and causality of biology. In our everyday society, twins, triplets et al. have an assigned position within all current and historical cultures—a shared tulpa of genetics, fate and timing. Twindom has a deep root in shared storytelling, its visuals conjure metatextual manifestations across the astrological, the mythological, the academic and the popular, stringing together tangents of the everyday and simultaneously karmic. By using three formats of film Polaroid, 120mm, and 4x5 by focusing on the simple idea of seeking an “intentional phenomenology” by direct image making, I can facilitate a broad and reflexive photographic engagement that is about these unique individuals.",http://justinaversano.com/,https://discord.gg/6kgcTUSVfR,https://twitter.com/justinaversano,https://instagram.com/justinaversano

500 unique artworks (1/1) for 500 dreams interpretations of Megalopolis.
Each artwork is accompanied by a translation, in poetic language, of the displayed dream (1520x1520 px - PNG).

GOD-EATER, machine of unknown origin, manages the I/O of Megalopolis.
Although no documentation exists about it, it is believed that its immense computing power allows it to interpret dreams.
According to common sense its interface can be deciphered as such (from top to bottom):


- the Legend (literally ""what must be read""),
- the Dream,
- the Awakening,
- the Consciousness,
- the Threshold Indicator.

The beauty of its interface as the mystery surrounding its origin (including its name) exert a real power of fascination on certain communities of crypto-hackers who dedicate a true cult to it.

In 2005 the book was mentioned in a keynote speech on US-Vietnam trade relations by Senator Max Baucus, as “a vision of a country on the go”, a reason to normalize trade relations between the two former adversaries. A photo book as policy maker.

In 2007 Bikes of Burden was in the Asian Art Biennial and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts acquired 12 large prints for its permanent collection. 

In 2011 an expanded edition of the book was published. The added section with more images aptly called Bikes of Burden - Reloaded.

J48BAFORMS (pronounced Jabbaforms) is a multifaceted artistic experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. The series contains 4,848 works of art that were minted at random.

The project began with 1,000 hand drawn ""LEGACYFORMS"" produced by the artist, which serves as the foundation for the series. After digitizing each LEGACYFORM, the dataset was processed through our GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Over the course of two weeks, the neural network learned and interpreted the original drawings, thereby producing machine-generated variants that feel like an organic extension of the artist’s work. J48BAFORMS offer an exciting array of rarities and styles, ranging from original hand drawn pieces to animated works with accompanying musical scores.",https://j48baforms.io/,https://discord.gg/cUgubJtCFN,https://twitter.com/J48BAFORMS,
